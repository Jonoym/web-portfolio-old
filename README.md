# web-portfolio
Website made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Within the JavaScript, ScrollTrigger and GSAP have been used. 

This website project was started in July of 2021 and features mostly the HMTL and CSS part of the website while the JavaScript is not yet fully functional. I wanted to focus on the animations and overall view design of the website while the content is mostly filler. Since I am not a front end developer and this was a project carried out for fun rather than business, features such as resume download and contact me forms do not work.

Features that the website include are:
- Loading Screen and a landing page
- Navbar which hides and reveals on scroll
- Animations on Scroll
- Working Navigation buttons
- Page change animations

Things Learnt:
- CSS code can easily become unmaintainable and requires good structure
- Importance of screen sizes and accessability of features 
- Class and ID structure of CSS
- Selection of items in JavaScript and how to manipulate style
